What is Rally?

Rally is a tool for software development. If you asked them I'm sure they'd say they do something 
with agile, but ultimately it's a task / defect tracking tool with the usual amount of Agile / Scrum
language sprinkled about. 

What does this site do? 

The Rally UI is.. shall we say... cumbersome to use. With rallyX (or whatever) we use the rally api
under the covers and show you a more modern looking user interface with improved safety features (like only saving fields you've changed, rather than saving everything on the model potentially overwriting someone elses changes)

Improvements..

1. editable comments (hopefully)
2. modern look (fonts you can read, design that pleases the eyes)
3. simplify rally's vast model thingey - too many, we care about 3 - defects, task and stories 
4. combine all tasks assigned to me in one place 
5. comments - first class citizen 
6. Add @mentions to comments (hopefully) with user notifications


Why do this? 

Many of us are forced to use Rally (rallydev) despite it not being very good. I'm sure beneath the UI
it's a perfectly good database - let's use that part and put our own less lame UI over it. 



? how much do we want to bash rally? (a little?)
